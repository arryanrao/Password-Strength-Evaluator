This file implements two key functions: `count_groups` and
`password_strength`. The `count_groups` function assesses the
password to identify the number of different character sets it uses
(lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols). The `password_strength`
function evaluates and returns the strength of the password based on
its length and character group variety. If any invalid characters
(spaces, tabs, newlines) are found, the password strength is set to 0.
